ps2-protokernel-patch - PS2 10K kernel patch
--------------------------------------------

This patch is to be applied on 10K PlayStation2 Kernel in order to fix
the buggy ExecPS2 syscall that mess up a lot of homebrew softwares running
on these early models.

To build this patch you need the PS2SDK:
https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk

To apply this patch, DO NOT RUN THE ELF!!!
You just need to load the unique elf section to it's proper virtual address.
Once done, the protokernel will use the patched syscall on every ExecPS2.

Thank to l_oliveira and Silverbull for sharing knowledge and stuff.
